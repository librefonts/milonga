  Milonga is a Font inspired on &acirc;&euro;&oelig;tangueros&acirc;&euro; art.
This is a tribute to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;rioplatense&acirc;&euro; culture, so colored, full of love and hate, family, friends and enemies stories told in countless Tangos and Milongas (folk music genre from Argentina).
This graceful, flowing and rhythmic font is formed by graphic elements found in a kind of classic painting from this area called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fileteado porte&Atilde;&plusmn;o&acirc;&euro;; with terminations involving petals, round and pointy details.

  Milonga is useful for headlines, where the characteristics of the font are highlighted.
